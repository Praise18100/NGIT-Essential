Task 1: 
In Week 1, I learned the fundamentals of computers and the internet, including how hardware and software work together and how online systems communicate. I was introduced to Git and GitHub for version control, which helps track changes and collaborate on code. I also learned how to use Visual Studio Code as a code editor and explored basic command line skills, which allow me to navigate files and run commands more efficiently. Overall, Week 1 gave me a strong foundation for future learning in programming and web development.

Task 2: 
cd web_basics
Moves into the web_basics folder.
mkdir cli_practice
Creates a new folder named cli_practice.
cd cli_practice
Opens the cli_practice folder.
type nul > test.txt
Creates an empty file named test.txt.
ren test.txt myfile.txt
Renames test.txt to myfile.txt.
dir
Displays all files and folders in the current directory.

Task 4: 
Domain name:
google.com
Uses HTTP or HTTPS:
It uses HTTPS, which means the connection is secure and encrypted.
What happens behind the scenes when you press Enter:
When you type google.com and press Enter, the browser first checks the DNS to find the IP address of Google’s server. After getting the IP, your browser sends a request to that server asking for the webpage. Since the site uses HTTPS, your browser also establishes a secure, encrypted connection. The server then sends back HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other files. Finally, your browser processes these files, builds the page structure, and displays the Google homepage on your screen.
